# Memory Game Project


## What is this?

This app is a simple memory game coded with pure javascript, css and HTML. It doesn't rely on any other external libraries such as jQuery or Bootstrap.

## Browser Compatibilities
The application is tested on Safari, Chrome and Firefox on Mac 10.13 (as of January 21. 2018)

## Javascript Version

I tried to use ES6 syntax and OOP techniques as much as possible in order to improve the reusability of the code

## How to play
